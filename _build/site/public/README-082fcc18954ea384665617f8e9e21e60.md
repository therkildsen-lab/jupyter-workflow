# jupyter-workflow
This is a template repository to automatically turn your project directory into a published github website based on your jupyter notebook(s).

All you need to do is clone this repository and make a few edits of `myst.yml` and you're pretty much golden. After that, add your markdown and/or
Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) into this directory, along with whatever data and other stuff there is.
